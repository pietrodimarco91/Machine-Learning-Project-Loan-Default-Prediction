HOW TO RUN THE NOTEBOOKS:

1) Put the train.csv and test.csv in the folder data/
2) Run the notebook 'DataExploration.ipynb' (or at least the first few cells, in order to create train_clean.csv and test_clean.csv)
3) Run the R script 'timeSeriesAnalysis.r' so that it generates in the folder data/other the files train_orders.csv and test_orders.csv containing the time series related features.
4) Run the 'Transform features.ipynb' notebook and generate the files data/train_predictedAges.csv and data/test_all_features.csv
5) Run the 'Feature_model_selection_and_final_prediction.ipynb' to create the predictions.csv and predictions_kaggle_format.csv files.

Note (1): We have already provided you the time series analysis files in data/other/* so that you can skip the step 3 and only have to run the notebooks.

Note (2): The notebooks (in particular the last one) can take a lot of time to execute. We have reduced the computation time as much as possible, but it can still be expensive.

Note (3): We provide you two predictions files: the first one is named 'predictions.csv' and contains all the informations of the test file with the target column DEFAULT PAYMENT JAN filled with our predictions. The second file is named 'predictions_kaggle_format.csv' and contains the same predictions but with the usual Kaggle format, with two columns: (CUST_COD, DEFAULT PAYMENT JAN)
